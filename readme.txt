Git is a distribution version control system.
Git is a free software distribution under the GPL.
Git has a mutable index called stage.
Git tracks changes of files.
It's my first time to use github !


This is the third time of learing git.
I want to master the usage of git.
This time, I have learned that the concept of stage area. Also I know that the new added file will not be tracked if it have not be sent to stage area. And usage of git reset and git diff and git rm 
git reset: unstage the staged file
git diff: firstly, it can be used to check the difference between the master and the head of the current workspace. Secondly, it can be used to compare the file and staged file by using git diff --staged 
git checkout: git checkout -- "some file" can be used to rmove all the changement made on "some file"
git rm: Not only remove the file on disk, but also remove it from stage.
